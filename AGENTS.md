## Communcation
- Always use Chinese to communicate with me, but use English for code comments.

## MCP
- Always use serena when you need to explore the code-base.
- Always use contex7 when you need to check documentations for libraries or frameworks.

## Documentation
- Technical notes/TODOs live in Serena memories.

## Coding
When modifying code, do it in small, incremental steps. After each step, explain what you changed and why.
When adding new files, only add skeleton codes (e.g. empty classes/functions with comments) first, then fill in the implementation in subsequent steps.

Between each step, explain, discuss, and get confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
